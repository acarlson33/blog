I like to think I'm an expierienced dev., I mean, I've been on the platform for almost 5 years now. But, if you want the truth, I'm just barely getting started on using all of the github features. (actions, prs, issues, etc.). Seems kind of strange right? I mean, if I've been around for 5 years, you would think that I'm better at those things. Right? Nope. Not at all.

So, I figure by now, you've probably checked my github. If you have, you'll notice something. The account I've linked is brand new. The first thing I would think in that situation is- wow, I'm being lied to. But that's not quite right. You see, I did used to have a github account before this one, but I deleted it. Whether or not on purpose or otherwise, I still haven't decided. But you will notice, that this account does seem to be well rounded in terms of the little commit graph thingy. Kinda strange right?

I like to think I'm gaining more skill. But recently, I opened my first PR on someone else's repo. Yeah. I'm serious.

<h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold pt-3 pb-3">Tip 1</h2>

If you're new to the platform, or the ecosystem as a whole, you might want to work on your own stuff for a while. You don't have to get popular, just familiarize yourself with the platform, and build up _something_ on your profile, so people will take you seriously.

<h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold pt-3 pb-3">Tip 2</h2>

If you want to find a project to contribute to, pick something that meets these criteria:

Number 1. It's not too big. If the tool is large, and contains tons or code, it's probably not a good fit for a first time contributor.

<br />
Number 2. It's not too small. If the tool is small, and contains only a few lines
of code, it's probably not a good fit for any contributor.
<br />
Number 3. It's at your skill level. If the project uses complicated tools or logic,
don't bother, you'll just end up wasting time.

<br />

If you pick something that meets these criteria, you'll get a project that, you understand, and can get support from a community on. Sometimes, creators compile lists of projects that would be a good fit for beginners to contribute to. You can always look at those, but don't feel pressured to learn somethign new just to contribute. Look for something you already understand, and help work on that.

<h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold pt-3 pb-3">Tip 3</h2>

Don't be afraid to bother people. I've opened issues or commented on one before. But no one would respond. If it's important, by all means, bother the contributors. But only to an extent. Don't keep constantly @'ing them. Just once or twice, and definitly not at once. That's a sure fire way of making people dislike you.

<h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold pt-3 pb-3">Tip 4</h2>

Watch videos and read blogs on the platform, and how to use it, and how it works. That will help you understand the innerworkings better.

<h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold pt-3 pb-3">Tip 5</h2>

This is a thing that most developers don't do, and it pisses me off.

For fucks sake, learn git. It's literally the thing the platform is built on. If you don't learn that, you won't understand how github works. Don't think you can avoid it. You can't. Just suck it up, and learn the damn thing. It sucks, I know, but sometimes we have to make sacrifices and do things we don't want to do. But in this case, it's probably one of the best decisions you can make. Because realistically, it will help you learn how to use github, and it will also help you when your coding in the future.

<h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold pt-3 pb-3">The end</h2>

This was a very shot post, I know. But I just wanted everyone to know some tips. I think this is kind of a "Do as I say, not as I do" case. Because, I probably won't. But, if it helps you- then it was totally worth it!
